# CombinePuzzle
CombinePuzzle is a math puzzle game consisting of numbered tiles, which can be split, combined, or added to the board, such that new tiles are created with different values.   The object is to eliminate your opponent's tiles by moving one of your pieces onto theirs, provided the value of your tile is larger. The opponent's tile is then eliminated, and all or a fraction of their points are added to your piece, which, if playing the computer, depends on your current level.  Tiles can only be moved to spaces adjacent to one 's own tiles and, as a strategy, new tiles can be created by swiping to an empty space, or, to add value to an existing tile, moving a piece onto another, creating a new tile having a value equal to the sum of the original two. Additionally, a piece at the bottom of the screen can be freely added next to any of your existing tiles, and each turn the piece is not used, its value increases by a fixed amount.  For an opponent you can play in single-player mode against a challenging computer (AI) player with two levels of difficulty, or play one of your friends in two-player mode (currently only on the same phone).   Two board settings exist, 5x5 and 6x6, and game wins and best game times are stored.
